      <h1><i class="fa-solid fa-code-branch fa-rotate-90 fa-xl"></i></h1>
      <p>You are a time traveler tasked with fixing the timeline, that is started to deviate from it's vector. </p>
      <p>Navigate through different historical periods, make crucial decisions, and maintain the stability of time itself.</p>
      <p>Be careful with your Temporal Energy - if it runs out, you'll be lost in the void of time forever! You can recharge your Temporal Energy, by sacrificing the Timeline Stability.</p>
      <p> Make sure to balance your energy and stability of the timeline, otherwise you will be faced with the consequences of your actions.</p>
      <p>Hint: <i>All the choices you make affect the timeline differently. Make sure you understand which timeperiod you are in. And what kind of world you want to live in when you get back to your own time after your mission.</i></p>
